						<td>"I've been using the Vision for a few days now and I think they're quite great. <br>They're very minimalistic and sleek and when you wear them you sometimes<br> forget you've even got them on I'll definitely be waiting to grab <br> one of these once they hit the shelves." - Alexandros Heckie</td>

					<tr>
						<td>"I dont mind these glasses at all. They're made out of a solid aluminium frame<br> which gives them some weight and adds a sense of high manufacturing quality, and<br> they're very responsive to touch. Even the voice recognition that's built in is designed well, <br> as it can pick up my accent with no problems at all. I just wish the UI was a bit <br> more easier to traverse somehow, but that can be fixed with a software update <br> at any time. Definitely recommend!" - Dionisio Paulino</td>

					<tr>
						<td>"Absolutely love these glasses. They haven't ran out of juice since when I first got them a week or so ago. I heard there were some new types of batteries in this but I didn't know they were that good! The menus are also nice and responsive, they dont lag as much as my phone does. The camera is stunning as well, I can see all of the smallest details in any image, which is quite impressive. Well done, PineApple, keep on going like this and you'll make it a long way in the tech industry, I reckon." - Denny Easton</td>
