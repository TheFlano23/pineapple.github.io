					<p class="bodytext"> The PineApple Vision is a new product straight out of PineApple Corp which will bring a combination of new futuristic and contemporary technologies to the consumer's hands for the first time. With a multitude of new features never before seen in any other device, you can be assured that you'll have access to whatever you need, wherever you are, whenever you'll need it. </p>

					
					<h2>What is the Vision?</h2>
					<p class="bodytext"> The PineApple Vision is one of the only pairs of augmented reality glasses available in the commercial market. Marketed towards tech enthusiasts and people across a variety of fields of work, the Vision will allow you to do ordinary, mundane activities in more efficient ways. The Vision has a high definition, optical image stabilisation camera, allowing for clear, high fidelity photos in the most shakiest scenarios. Newer models include a night mode for darker environments where one may not be able to see what's in front of them. </p>

					<p class="bodytext">The Vision has two different variants suited for different users. The Vision A is for the average consumer who would like to experience what the Vision has to offer.    The X model is our flagship device designed for high end businesses and enterprises, and any tech enthusiasts wanting to experience everything Vision has to offer. With a 30 megapixel night mode and OIS equipped camera capable of taking wide angle and optically zoomed images up to 3x, support for dual Nano SIM cards, the implementation of revolutionary graphine aluminium-ion batteries capable of running for days on end, and 512GB of included onboard storage which can be expanded when needed, this is by far our most definitive way to experience Vision. </p>
